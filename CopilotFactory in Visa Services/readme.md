# AI-Powered Visa Application Orchestration Engine  

**Developed by CodeSizzler from CopilotFactory for a Visa Processing Consulting Company**

---

## 1. Vision & Objective  
To architect and deploy a scalable, secure, and intelligent visa application orchestration platform. This system leverages the **Microsoft Power Platform** to automate the front-office customer interaction and mid-office document processing layers, integrating seamlessly with existing back-office visa management systems via APIs.  

**Primary Objectives:**  
- Achieve **end-to-end process automation**.  
- Reduce manual touchpoints by **80%+**.  
- Ensure compliance through **AI-driven validation**.  
- Provide measurable improvements in **efficiency, accuracy, and scalability**.

## 2. Core Architectural Components & Technologies  

| **Layer** | **Technology** | **Purpose & Technical Specification** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Presentation Layer** | **Microsoft Copilot Studio** | Conversational UI with custom topics for each visa type. Conditional branching handles complex dialogues. Embedded into the service center's public website via `<iframe>` or JavaScript snippet. |
| **Orchestration Layer** | **Microsoft Power Automate (Cloud Flows)** | Acts as the orchestration engine. Flows include: `Trigger-NewApplication`, `Process-DocumentUpload`, `Validate-ApplicationCompleteness`, `Submit-ToBackendAPI`, `Trigger-StatusUpdate`. Uses **HTTP with Azure AD OAuth 2.0** for secure API connections. |
| **Data Layer** | **Microsoft Dataverse** | Chosen over SharePoint for enterprise security and relational data. Tables include: `Applications`, `Applicants`, `Documents`, `Checklists`, `StatusHistory`. |
| **AI/ML Layer** | **AI Builder (Form Processing & Object Detection Models)** | Extracts structured fields (Name, DOB, Expiry) from documents. Object Detection validates critical elements (passport photo, MRZ, bank logos). |
| **Integration Layer** | **Azure API Management (APIM)** | Provides API gateway, logging, throttling, transformation, and secure outbound connectivity between Power Platform and legacy backend systems. |
| **Security & Identity** | **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** | Centralized authentication/authorization. Uses Service Principals (App Registrations) with least-privilege access to Dataverse and external APIs. |

## 3. Detailed Technical Process Flow  

### Phase 1: Application Initiation & Data Collection  
1. Applicant initiates chat on the website.  
2. **Copilot Studio** calls a Power Automate Instant Flow â†’ creates `applicationID` in Dataverse.  
3. Dynamic checklist loaded from Dataverse `Checklist` table.  
4. Applicant answers stored in real-time against `Applications` & `Applicants` tables.  

---

### Phase 2: AI-Powered Document Processing  
1. Applicant uploads a document (e.g., passport scan). Stored temporarily in Azure Blob Storage.  
2. A Power Automate Flow is triggered:  
   - **Step 1: OCR & Extraction** â†’ Calls AI Builder Form Processing model â†’ returns field confidence scores (e.g., `FirstName: 98%`, `ExpiryDate: 95%`).  
   - **Step 2: Data Cross-Check** â†’ Expiry date validation & name matching against Phase 1 data.  
   - **Step 3: Image Validation** â†’ AI Builder Object Detection confirms MRZ and biometric photo presence.  
   - **Step 4: Result Handling:**  
     - **Valid (â‰¥90% confidence)** â†’ Update `Documents` table as `Validated`, move file to secure container.  
     - **Invalid** â†’ Update as `ValidationFailed`, log errors, prompt applicant for re-upload.  

---

### Phase 3: Submission & Integration  
1. Applicant requests submission.  
2. Power Automate queries `Documents` table for completeness.  
3. If complete, a JSON payload is constructed from `Applications` & `Applicants` tables.  
4. Payload sent to **Government Visa API** via Azure API Management.  
5. API returns `202 Accepted` with `correlationID`.  
6. A polling flow checks the correlationID status every 6 hours, updating `StatusHistory` in Dataverse.  

---

### Phase 4: Status Query & Proactive Updates  
- **Status Query:** Applicant asks for status â†’ Copilot Studio triggers flow â†’ reads latest `StatusHistory`.  
- **Proactive Updates:** Daily scheduled flow polls Government API. If status changes, it alerts an internal reviewer. Once approved, Outlook connector sends a branded email to the applicant.

## 4. Technical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  

| **KPI** | **Before Implementation** | **After Implementation** | **Measurement Method** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Process Automation Rate** | <20% (mostly manual) | >85% zero-touch automation | Dataverse logs & flow history |
| **AI Model Accuracy** | N/A (manual validation) | 90â€“95% confidence scores | AI Builder performance dashboard |
| **Application Processing Time** | 5â€“7 business days | 1â€“2 business days | Average timestamps between submission & validation |
| **Document Validation Rate** | 65â€“70% on first upload | 90%+ on first upload | Dataverse `Documents.Status` |
| **Applicant Follow-ups** | 3â€“4 emails per applicant | <1 email per applicant | Outlook/Dataverse comms log |
| **Operational Cost per Application** | High (manual staff-intensive) | ~40% cost reduction | Finance cost allocation reports |
| **Scalability** | ~100 apps/day | 500+ apps/day | Flow execution + API throughput |
| **Error Rate** | 8â€“10 failures/1000 runs | <2 failures/1000 runs | Power Platform Admin Center analytics |

## 5. Security & Compliance Considerations  
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all communications; OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow.  
- **Data at Rest**:  
  - Dataverse encrypts all records by default.  
  - Azure Blob Storage encrypted with **Storage Service Encryption (SSE)**.  
- **Data Residency**: All Power Platform + Azure resources deployed in-region (EU/UK, etc.) to meet sovereignty laws.  
- **PII Handling**: No human intervention unless escalated. AI Builder models run in-region for compliance.  
- **Auditing**:  
  - Dataverse tables with full auditing enabled.  
  - All flow runs logged to Azure Log Analytics.  
  - Integration with SIEM systems for real-time monitoring.
